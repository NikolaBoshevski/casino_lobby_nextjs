# Casino Game List Project

## How to run the project

1. run "npm install"
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000 
4. Alternatively visit: https://casinolobbynextjsdeploy.vercel.app/ to visit the deployed website.

## What I built

- I built a website, where you can see all available games, filter them by name, provider, and category. You can add to favorites your favorite games, by clicking on the heart icon, and also filter the games by favorites

## One thing I found challenging

- I have to say Redux setup, since this was a simple project I did not use Redux that much so the time I spent setting it up could've been used elsewhere

## One thing I would improve with more time

- Setting up Redux faster and using it efficiently.
