# Notes about the overall development of the project

## How much time spent

- I spent around 3 or 3.5 days of development, which was around 10 - 12 hours of development time. 

## What you learned while building this

- I learned more about Redux and filtering items/elements by making use of useSearchParams

## Problems I ran into

- As with any project I ran into some issues regarding the filtering, since there are multiple filters, and I had to find a way to filter all the items based on all of the filters selected

## Bonus: What would I improve regarding this project:

1. Fetch the data from an API
2. Disable a category button if there are no games from that category (currently it just does not exist if there are no games of that category)
3. Create a page and use a <Link/> to link the user to that game's page
4. Store "favorite"  state in the backend/database instead of localStorage
5. Pagination
6. Create a Button component in which I would style my button and use it in my other components
